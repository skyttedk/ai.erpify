When asked to do any form of clean up, refactoring and streamlining 
use the following principles

1. Code Clean Up.
   Is there any redundant code that can be removed.

2. Refactor. 
   Can we refactor, without adding complexity.

3. Update documentation for functions.

In general, Keep code clean and sleek and simple. Dont build a Rube Goldberg Machine.
