# Your rule content

models  are located in server/models

if a user request a new model, then create a new file in this directory based upon

[model.template](mdc:server/models/model.template)


remember to add the model to modelPaths in [model.template](mdc:server/models/model.template)

if a user requests to update a model, then just update the model requested with the changes requested.

Note: Stick to the schema and examples, dont add un nessecary methods and stuff.
