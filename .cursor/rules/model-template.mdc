# Your rule content

models  are located in server/models

if a user request a new model, then create a new file in this directory based upon

[schema.json](mdc:server/models/schema.json)

and examples  : [Customer.js](mdc:server/models/Customer.js) [User.js](mdc:server/models/User.js)

remember to add the field to fieldPaths in @index.js

if a user requests to update a model, then just update the model requested with the changes requested.

Note: Stick to the schema and examples, dont add un nessecary methods and stuff.
