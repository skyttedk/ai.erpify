# Your rule content

models  are located in server/models

if a user request a new model, then create a new file in this directory based upon

[model.template](mdc:server/models/model.template)

remember to add the model to modelPaths in [model.template](mdc:server/models/model.template)


The user may suggest fields to add to the model, if not, feel free to look in the server/models/fields
for fields that would be suitable. 

for example, is user requests a Country model, then perhaps fields like

 CountryCode :  new fields.Code10Field(),
 Name :  new fields.String250Field()
 
 would be suitable.

if a user requests to update a model, then just update the model requested with the changes requested.

Note: Stick to the schema and examples, dont add un nessecary methods and stuff.
