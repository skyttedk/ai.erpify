# Your rule content

field templates are located in server/models/fields

if a user request a new field template, then create a new file in this directory based upon

[field templates.txt](mdc:ai.design.desc/server.orm.field.template/field templates.txt)

remember to add the field to fieldPaths in [index.js](mdc:server/models/fields/index.js)

Note: Stick to the schema and examples, dont add un nessecary methods and stuff.
