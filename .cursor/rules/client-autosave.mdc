When coding changes in the client form autosave feature, make sure the following is always true.

1. Send updates/insert only when user tabs out of a dirty input field.

2. If id = 0, then we should create a record, if id <> 1 then wo shuold update record.

3. ENTER should work like TAB.

4. If we changed a value, and did not tab out of input field. 
    then if user presses Escape. then

     -undo value

    if the user presses escape again,
    
    - close form as today.

5. If we changed a value, and did not tab out of input field. 
  then if user uses navigation/new/delete

    there should come a modal dialog with something like "You have unsaved changes"..

if the user presses escape again,

- close form as today.

5. when receiving a response from server after injserting /creating we shuold check
   if there success = false, and if so, we should show the message from server in a modal dialog. We should not be able to exit a input field with error, unless we
   roll back to old value.
