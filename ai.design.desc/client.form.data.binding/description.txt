Too Way Data Binding

Solution Approach

1. Create a Custom Element
Custom Element Definition:
Use the Custom Elements API to define a new HTML element (for example, <bindable-input>).

Shadow DOM:
In the constructor of the custom element, attach a shadow DOM and add an <input> element to it. This ensures that the component's internal structure is encapsulated.

2. Implement Data Binding Logic
Internal State:

Maintain two private properties: one for the data record (_record) and one for the specific field (_field) in that record.
Setters for Binding:

Provide a record setter to assign the data record.
Provide a field setter to assign the specific field within the record.
When either is set, call an updateValue() method that reads the current value from the record and updates the <input> element accordingly.
Listening for User Input:

Add an event listener for the input event on the <input> element.
In the event handler (onInput()), update the underlying data record with the new value from the input.
Optionally dispatch a custom event (e.g., data-changed) with details about the change.
3. Event Dispatching
Custom Event:
After updating the record with the new value, dispatch a custom event to notify any external listeners that the data has changed.
This allows other parts of the application to react to the change if needed.
4. Complete Example Structure
HTML Structure:

Include the custom element in the HTML document.
Optionally display the current state of the data record (for example, in a <pre> element) to visualize the changes in real time.
Script Structure:

Define the custom element class with all of the above logic.
Register the custom element using customElements.define().
Create a sample data record (a plain JavaScript object).
Bind the record and the specific field (for example, "name") to the custom element.
Add an event listener to update the display when the data changes.
Summary of the Complete Implementation
Custom Element Class (BindableInput):

Constructor:
Attach a shadow DOM.
Create an <input> element.
Attach an input event listener that calls onInput().
Properties:
record: Setter that stores the data record and calls updateValue().
field: Setter that stores the field name and calls updateValue().
Methods:
updateValue(): Reads the value from the data record (using the provided field) and updates the input element.
onInput(): Updates the data record when the user types into the input and dispatches a custom event (data-changed).
Application Code:

Instantiate a data record.
Get a reference to the custom element in the DOM.
Set the record and field properties on the custom element.
Listen for the custom data-changed event and update any UI components (like a <pre> element) to show the current state of the record.
Re-Implementation Guidelines for Another AI
When re-implementing this solution, please ensure the following:

Custom Element with Shadow DOM:

Use the Custom Elements API.
Create a shadow DOM in the constructor and add the internal <input> element.
Data Binding Setters:

Implement setters for record and field.
Ensure that any change to these properties triggers an update of the input's value via a helper function (e.g., updateValue()).
Event Handling:

Add an event listener for the input event on the internal <input> element.
In the event listener, update the bound data record's specified field with the new value.
Dispatch a custom event (like data-changed) containing details about the updated field and value.
HTML Integration:

Demonstrate how the custom element can be used in an HTML document.
Include sample code that binds a data record to the custom element and updates a visible display (like a <pre> element) when the data changes.
Code Clarity and Extensibility:

Write clear, maintainable code with appropriate comments.
Ensure the solution is modular so that it can be extended (e.g., supporting different types of input elements in the future).
