1. Problem Statement
In an ERP application, forms and lists are used throughout the system for various data models (e.g., customers, orders, products). The goal is to build a declarative form definition system that:

Removes the need for developers to make design decisions for each form.
Standardizes the look and feel of all forms, lists, and lookup/search screens.
Provides an extensible configuration that can be parsed and rendered by the application.
2. Requirements
2.1 Functional Requirements
Form Types: The configuration should support multiple form types such as:

List: A list view of records.
Form: A detailed form for a single record.
Lookup/Search: A screen for finding and selecting a record.
Others as required (e.g., dashboard, report viewer).
Data Source Integration:

Each form must be associated with a data source (or model), such as "customers", "orders", etc.
Optional filtering capability should be provided to restrict the data displayed.
Permissions and Actions:

The configuration should allow enabling/disabling actions like insert, delete, and modify.
It should support menu definitions including submenus and action items.
Each menu item should specify an action (e.g., function name, report generation command).
Layout and Grouping:

The form layout should be defined in a declarative manner.
Fields can be grouped together under logical sections (e.g., “Shipping Info”, “Billing Info”).
Each group can have its own caption and a list of fields.
Field Definition:

Each field should have properties like:
name: A unique identifier.
caption: Display label.
type: Data type (e.g., text, number, date).
required: Boolean to mark if the field is mandatory.
Additional properties (e.g., validation rules, formatting).
2.2 Non-Functional Requirements
Consistency:
All forms and lists should be rendered consistently regardless of the underlying data model.
Extensibility:
The configuration should be easily extendable to add new properties or new form types in the future.
Ease of Use:
Developers should be able to define forms without needing to write additional code for layout or action handling.
Machine Readability:
The configuration should be written in a standard format (e.g., JSON) to allow automated parsing and processing.
3. Proposed JSON Schema
Below is an example JSON schema that captures the requirements. This schema serves as both documentation and an implementation guide.

Explanation
General Form Properties:

caption: The title of the form.
type: Specifies the form type (list, form, lookup, search, etc.).
dataSource: The model name from which data is fetched.
filter: A string that can be used to apply a default filter on the data.
Permissions:

Encapsulated in a permissions object that contains boolean flags for actions such as insert, delete, and modify.
Menu:

An array of menu groups. Each group includes a caption and an items array.
Each menu item includes a caption and an action property that maps to a function or command within the application.
Layout:

The layout is an array that allows multiple groups to be defined.
Each group has a caption and a fields array.
Each field in the group defines:
name: The unique field identifier (for binding to the data source).
caption: The display label.
type: The type of the field (e.g., text, number).
required: Indicates if the field is mandatory.
Additional field-level attributes (e.g., validation rules, default values) can be added as needed.
4. Implementation Considerations
4.1 Parsing and Rendering
Parser Component: Build a parser that reads the JSON configuration and translates it into the application's internal UI components.
Renderer Component: The renderer takes the parsed configuration and creates the UI (using a framework like React, Angular, or Vue.js) in a consistent manner.
Dynamic Menus: Ensure that the menu items can trigger actions that are dynamically linked to back-end functions or client-side scripts.
4.2 Extensibility and Validation
Schema Validation: Use a JSON schema validation tool to ensure that the configuration meets the expected format. This helps catch errors early.
Extending Fields: Provide a mechanism for extending field definitions (e.g., adding maxLength, pattern, or custom validation functions).
Custom Layouts: Although the basic layout is predefined, allow for hooks or plugins if a particular form needs a custom layout behavior.
4.3 Internationalization (i18n)
Consider including internationalization support for captions and labels. This might involve referencing keys that map to a resource file rather than static text.
5. Example Use Cases
Use Case 1: Customer List View
Type: List
Data Source: customers
Features: Allows filtering, inserting new records, deleting, and modifying existing records.
Menu: Provides report generation and export options.
Layout: Displays key shipping and billing information grouped for clarity.
Use Case 2: Order Details Form
Type: Form
Data Source: orders
Features: Allows modification of order details, with validations on order fields.
Menu: Could include actions like "Print Invoice" or "Track Order".
Layout: Groups order summary, shipping details, and payment information.
6. Summary
The declarative form definition system is designed to:

Simplify form creation by removing manual UI design decisions.
Provide a consistent and standardized user experience.
Enable rapid development and maintenance by using a configuration-driven approach.
Ensure flexibility and extensibility for future requirements.
This detailed description, along with the JSON schema, should provide a clear blueprint for another AI or developer to implement a similar solution in an ERP application.
