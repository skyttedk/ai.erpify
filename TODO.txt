Improve error handling: Implement consistent error handling and logging across the application.

Standardize coding style: Implement ESLint and Prettier for consistent code formatting.

Add JSDoc documentation: Improve code documentation, especially for API endpoints and model methods.

Optimize socket service: The current implementation has unnecessary reconnection logic and could be more efficient.

Optimize database queries: Review and optimize database access patterns in the ORM.

Refactor the models system: The current model system seems complex - consider simplifying it.

Add proper CSRF protection: Implement CSRF tokens for added security.
